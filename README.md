1. Set Up the Environment
Choose a programming language (e.g., Python) and a web development framework (e.g., Flask or Django).
Install Necessary Libraries
Install libraries for PDF processing (PyMuPDF or PyPDF2), natural language processing (NLTK or SpaCy), and vector embeddings (e.g., SentenceTransformers for Google embeddings).

2. PDF Processing
Extract Relevant Information
Create a module to parse and extract relevant information from PDF files, such as text, headings, and metadata.

3. Vector Embeddings and Database Integration
Use Google Embeddings Model
Leverage pre-trained Google embeddings models (Word2Vec, BERT, etc.) or SentenceTransformers to create vector embeddings for the extracted text.
Choose a Vector Database
Select a vector database like Pinecone or Chroma and integrate it into your system.
Store Embeddings
Store the vector embeddings in the database for efficient retrieval.

4. Test Question Generation
User Input Handling
Implement a web interface for users to specify topics, chapters, subjects, or class levels.
Question Generation
Use a language model (e.g., GPT-3) to generate objective or subjective test questions based on the retrieved information.

5. Web Development
Develop User Interface
Build a user-friendly web interface allowing users to upload PDFs, input criteria, and view generated questions.
Backend Integration
Connect the web interface with the backend logic for processing PDFs, extracting information, generating vector embeddings, and creating test questions.
Deployment
Deploy the application on a server, making it accessible over the web.
